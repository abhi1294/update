   <img src="maxresdefault.jpg" alt="trap and bass" width="300px" height="200px">
   <p>Bass Traps are acoustic energy absorbers which are
      designed to damp low frequency sound
      energy with the goal of attaining a
       flatter low frequency (LF) room
       response by reducing LF resonances in
       rooms. They are commonly used in
        recording studios, mastering rooms,
         home theatres and other rooms built
          to provide a critical listening
          environment.
